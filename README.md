# AbeewayDemo

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build for production

Run `ng build --prod --build-optimizer --base-href /abeeway-demo/` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Replace `/abeeway-demo/` by the base URL of your production application.

## Notes
Please note that this application is fully static. It does not use any online API. All scripts run inside your browser so that you can easily add the GUI to your existing application just by copying the content of the `dist/` folder after compliling the app with the `ng build` command.
